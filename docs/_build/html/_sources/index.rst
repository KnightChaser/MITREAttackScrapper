   from pprint import pprint
   from MITREAttackScrapper.techniques.enterprise import MITREAttackEnterpriseTechniques
   from MITREAttackScrapper.tactics.enterprise import MITREAttackEnterpriseTactics
   from MITREAttackScrapper.mitigations.enterprise import MITREAttackEnterpriseMitigations
   from MITREAttackScrapper.superclass import MITREAttackInformation

   def render(mitre: MITREAttackInformation) -> None:
       """
       Render the MITRE ATT&CK data.
       """
       data = mitre.get_list()
       target_id = data[0]["id"]
       pprint(mitre.get(target_id))

   if "__main__" == __name__:
       render(MITREAttackEnterpriseTechniques)
       render(MITREAttackEnterpriseTactics)
       render(MITREAttackEnterpriseMitigations)
       print("Done!")

Modules Overview
================

The MITREAttackScrapper package is organized into several modules:

- **cti**: Handles the scraping of CTI(Cyber Threat Intelligence) data.
- **mitigations**: Manages the retrieval of cyberthreat mitigation strategies against attacks techniques
- **tactics**: Extracts tactical information.
- **techniques**: Gathers data on various techniques.
- **utils**: Provides utility functions to support scraping and data handling.

For detailed information on each module, refer to the respective documentation pages.
